// I’m a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student from JK Lakshmipat University with a strong focus on MERN full stack development. I’ve completed a Full Stack Developer internship at Creatives Clicks, where I worked on building responsive React interfaces and integrating RESTful APIs with a Node.js and MongoDB backend for real-time client projects.

// I’ve built a full-stack e-commerce platform called UrbanNest using the MERN stack, where I implemented user authentication, product management, and optimized API and database performance for scalability.

// Along with web development, I also have a solid foundation in Data Structures, OOP, and backend concepts, and I’ve worked on a sentiment analysis project using machine learning and deployed it with Streamlit.

// I enjoy building real-world applications, learning by doing, and I’m currently looking for a MERN full stack role where I can contribute to production-level projects while growing as a developer.”


// “UrbanNest is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack. The frontend is developed in React with a responsive and user-friendly UI, while the backend uses Node.js and Express to expose RESTful APIs, and MongoDB for data storage.

// The platform includes user authentication, product listing, cart functionality, and order management. I implemented role-based access where admins can manage products and users.

// I focused on optimizing API performance by structuring efficient routes and optimizing MongoDB queries, ensuring the application is scalable and performs well under load.”



// “During my Full Stack Developer internship at Creatives Clicks, I worked on real-time client projects where my primary responsibility was developing frontend components using React and integrating them with backend REST APIs.

// I collaborated with backend developers to connect APIs using Axios, handled form validation, and ensured smooth data flow between frontend and backend.

// On the backend, I worked with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to implement business logic, optimize database queries, and test APIs using Postman. I also used Git for version control and followed proper development workflows.”
